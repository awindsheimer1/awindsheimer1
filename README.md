### Welcome to my profile!

### I am a recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh, from which I now possess a B.S. in Statistics. I am looking to enter the field of Data Analytics, and I am excited to not only apply my knowledge but also to learn more about the vast world of stats. My special interest is in Sports Analytics, particularly with regards to hockey, March Madness, and football. 

### On this page, I present relevant projects from my time at Pitt. Many of these were final projects designed to comprehensively apply course material, but others were deep dives into a particular topic.

### For some of these, I was able to repurpose work I had done in my free time. Accordingly, I have also included some programs that were never submitted for anything, but are simply passion projects.
